-- 1. Create a table called person that records a personâ€™s id, name, age, height (in cm) , city, favorite_color. The id should be an auto-incrementing id/primary key (use type: SERIAL)

create table person(
    id serial primary key,
    name varchar(50),
    age integer not null,
    height integer,
    city varchar(50),
    fav_color varchar(50)
)

-- 2. Add 5 different people into the person database. Remember to not include the person_id because it should auto-increment.

INSERT INTO person (name, age, height, city, fav_color)
VALUES ('John', '34', '185', 'Temecula', 'Red'),
        ('DaQuan', '33', '189', 'Honolulu', 'Blue')
        ('Kivon', '31', '192', 'Colorado Springs', 'Green')
        ('Shakoya', '29', '177', 'Ft. Drum', 'Purple')
        ('Shaniqua', '28', '189', 'Pueblo', 'Pink')
